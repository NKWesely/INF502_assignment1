        "At the start of my GCF() function, I first need to figure out which input from the user is the larger integer. If input \"a\" is larger than input \"b\", the high number \"a\" is divided by the low number \"b\", and the remainder of that division is saved in the variable \"r\". Then the code checks to see if the remainder \"r\" is equal to zero. If the remainder \"r\" is equal to zero, then I return the low number from the previous division (\"b\") as the greatest common factor (\"gcf\").\n",
        "\n",
        "If the remainder \"r\" is not equal to zero, then I need to keep doing successive division. I do this by calling the GCF() again, but this time I feed it \"b\" for the first input, and the remainder \"r\" as the second input. This means that in the next round of division, the low number in the previous division (\"b\") will be the high number in the next division, and the remainder from the previous division (\"r\") will be the low number in the next division.\n",
        "\n",
        "This would continue happening until the remainder \"r\" was equal to zero. So the function GCF() would continue to be recursively called until the greatest common factor is found (which is indicated by the remainder \"r\" = 0).\n",
        "\n",
        "If the user's input \"a\" is not larger than the user's input \"b\", then the code moves to the \"else\" statement towards the bottom of the function definition (line 23 in code chunk below). Within the \"else\" statement, the GCF() function is also called again, but this time feeding the user's input \"b\" as the first input and the user's input \"a\" as the second input into the GCF() fucntion. Then in the second call of GCF(), the user's input \"b\" would be passed as the new input \"a\", so then \"a\" would be larger than \"b\", and the if statement (in line 6 in the code chunk below) would be True, and the recursive division would commence. \n",

This makes the code enter a while loop where the user will remain until their inputs are correct. Inside the while loop, the code tries to get the user's inputs and convert them to integer objects. If the \"try\" statement fails, the user is sent an error and would be returned to the top of the while loop. If the \"try\" statement is successful, the code would move on to the \"else\" statement. Inside the \"else\", the code checks to see if both inputs are greater than zero (ie checks to see if the inputs are positive numbers). If the numbers are both positive, then the \"goodToGo\" variable gets redefined as \"True\", which would cause the code to exit the while loop. If either of the inputs is not greater than zero (ie they are not positive numbers), the user gets an error and the code returns to the top of the while loop again. \n",

Assuming that the user inputs 48 and 30 correctly, my program would move past my exception handling code within my main() function. Then my GCF() function gets called and the user's two inputs (here c1 = 48 & c2 = 30) get fed into the GCF() function.
