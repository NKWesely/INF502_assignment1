        "At the start of my GCF() function, I first need to figure out which input from the user is the larger integer. If input \"a\" is larger than input \"b\", then I set a new variable \"high\" equal to \"a\" and another new variable \"low\" equal to \"b\". If \"b\" is greater than \"a\", then I set \"b\" equal to \"high\" and \"a\" equal to \"low\". Next, I initialize the \"r\" variable with something silly to enter the while loop. While \"r\" does not equal zero, the code remains in the while loop. Inside the while loop, the \"high\" number is divided by the \"low\" number, and the remainder of that division is saved in the variable \"r\". Then the code checks to see if the remainder \"r\" is equal to zero. If the remainder \"r\" is not equal to zero, then I need to keep doing successive division. So the \"high\" variable is redefined as the \"low\" number in the previous division, and the \"low\" variable is redefined as the remainder \"r\". Then the code would go back to the top of the while loop and do the same division again. Once the remainder \"r\" becomes equal to zero, the code exits the while loop and skips over the if statement (where \"high\" and \"low\" get redefined). Then a new variable \"gcf\" gets defined as equal to \"low\" (the \"low\" number from the last time through the while loop). Finally, the function returns the \"gcf\" variable.\n"

If the \"try\" statement fails, the user is sent an error and would be returned to the top of the while loop. If the \"try\" statement is successful, the code would move on to the \"else\" statement. Inside the \"else\", the code checks to see if both inputs are greater than zero (ie checks to see if the inputs are positive numbers). If the numbers are both positive, then the \"goodToGo\" variable gets redefined as \"True\", which would cause the code to exit the while loop.
